- Daemon that runs  in the background on startup
- Spins infinitely
- Run one program (service.c) at the start, and that starts up the server
- Other processes can start up (client), and that’ll connect them to the server
- Separate database file
- When the client connects, it’ll open the file
    - Implementing Flisk
- For this, you'll implement a trusted UNIX daemon that provides services to the rest of the system. Does the Daemon need to run in a specific operating system?
- inetd, init
- Different file descriptors for different permissions
- When they connect, we give them the file descriptor to the database
- Goal:
    - Set up the client server so that a user can connect to the server
    - Passing the file descriptor back to the client
    - On the same device, pass back to the client
    - Ask SQL to open N different databases using a file descriptor.
        - Need to check to make sure that this is possible in SQLite.
        - If not possible, have server run SQL queries and write to a file, then provide users the output to that file via a file descriptor. 
    - Input sql query and read or write to the database
        - Insert SQL Query
    - Default read-write permissions. Once basic and tests are successful, then we can increment progress
- Additional Goals:
    - If time permits, try with multiple clients on different machines.
